## ⚡ Fun Fact
Did you know? The term "Blockchain" originated from the way transactions are linked together through cryptographic hashes. Each block in the chain contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, creating a secure and unalterable sequence. This concept was initially introduced in the whitepaper titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008.
